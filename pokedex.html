								<h2>The PokeDex</h2>
								<p> 
									This app allows you to search for any Pokémon across the 8 generations. 
									You can use the search function to find a Pokémon by name, element type or by region. 
									Choosing a Pokémon will let you see more details about its evolutions and a set of 
									interesting facts you can read.

								</p>
									<h2>Building a PokeDex</h2>
								<p> 
									My goal for this app was to learn how to handle more complex JSON data, implement the MVVM design pattern 
									and build the entire app programmatically focusing on writing structured and readable code.       
								</p>
								<h3>Working with the PokeAPI</h3>
								<p>
									The first step to building the PokeDex was to create the "Network Engine" class that would handle the API call
									for the different endpoints I wanted to gather data from. While writing this class I used the Result type to return 
									a success or failure case making it clearer in the code how a response to the API would be confirmed. 
									<br><br>
									I initially had difficulty understanding how to access the different endpoints as the JSON for the PokeAPI is nested within different
									fields and objects. Eventually I was able to workout how to best organize the different endpoints and made separate functions
									for each specific endpoint I was targeting. This made it easier when calling for the different data points in the view controllers. 
									<br><br>
									I also learned more about GCD as I explored how to handle calling the different endpoints and found how session.dataTask pushes 
									the work to a background thread which I then needed to bring back to the main thread to see my results. While I didn't end up using 
									GCD to setup my own dispatch groups I did experiment quite a bit while building out my network calls. 
									<br><br>
									Overall writing and implementing
									my "Network Engine" class helped me learn how to use the Result type for cleaner network calls and explore GCD. 

								</p>
								<h3>Building the UI</h3>
								<p>
									My goal for building the UI was to learn how to use the MVVM design pattern and build each view controller programmatically. 
									The PokeDex has 3 view controllers, one is for the main view which displays all the pokemon in a collection view, another is 
									for displaying an individual pokemon and facts in a table view and the last controller is part of the search controller which gives
									the user category options they can select all laid out in another collection view. 
									<br><br>
									The main takeaway I learned from implementing the MVVM pattern 
									was separating my data into its own struct and formatting it within the initialization of the object. Upon creating the object I could then 
									declare it as a variable with the structs type in my custom view classes for the different collection and table views and only have to worry 
									about how to layout the information in the view.

								<h2>Highlights</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Created a "Network Engine" class to handle the API call using the Result type in the functions to make handling the 
										response more readable. 
									</li>
									<li>
										The UI of the app was made programmatically with a focus on the MVVM design pattern and writing the code in each class in a
										structured manner for easier readability. 
									</li>
									<li>
										The app implements a custom search controller that gives category choices laid out in a collection view that translates the chosen 
										option as text to the search bar for filtering. The search controller also allows for searching by the Pokemon's name, type or region. 
									</li>
								</ul>
