								<h2>STEMMINDS Corp - STEM Educator / Lead Game Developer - 05/2018 - 01/2020</h2>
								<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									<li>
										At STEMMINDS I set out to learn how technology was being integrated with our education system. 
										I wanted to make an impact as a technology educator and learn how to use a variety of different technologies. 
										My goal was to inspire others to bring their ideas to life through teamwork, problem-solving, and applying technical skills.  
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>I worked on a major government-funded project to develop software for the company's online STEM platform. 
										This was a new initiative for the company that was aimed at giving STEM courses on robots, web technologies, 
										and video game creation to elementary schools to make incorporating STEM into the curriculum easier for teachers. 
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>The challenges I overcame for this project were:</li>
									<ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
											<li>learning how to use Unity to create the video games.</li>
											<li>Working on a small team and learning how to collaborate on projects. </li>
											<li>Leading teams of co-op students to build games using Unity.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<li><h3>Learning a new technology</h3></li>
									<li style="padding-left: 50px;">
										To learn new technology quickly my approach is to understand why I need to use that particular tool. 
										It comes from starting with a plan of what the product needs to do and visualizing the end result. 
										From that, I can narrow down what tool would be best for the task and proceed to learn how to use it. 
										<br><br>
										For this project, Unity was the chosen solution for its ease of use, flexibility, and well-supported community. 
										The way I got up to speed with Unity was by making small projects focusing on making individual features work on a small scale before scaling it up to the main project.
										My approach to learning a new piece of technology through reading and experimenting with small projects is how I am able to learn quickly and build faster. 

									</li>
									<br>
									<li><h3>Executing a plan and collaborating</h3></li>
									<li style="padding-left: 50px;">
										Once I became more proficient with Unity, the next step was to create a plan of action
										and collaborate with the team towards building the software. 
										<br><br>
										The approach was to build a framework for each project that needed to be created. 
										The templates outlined the details for the project and features that would be implemented. 
										This approach made it easier for keeping track of our ideas and maintaining flexibility if changes needed to be made.
										<br><br>

										When building the projects in Unity, I suggested that we test our collaboration 
										through small projects to understand how to combine our work and keep things organized. 
										We tested using Git for Unity to make code changes to scripts easier to manage and worked on separate scenes within the same project. 
										This approach worked well on several of the projects that required different features. 
										For example, I worked on the UI and controls for the player while my co-worker designed the level and interactions. 
										When it came time to sync up our work we were able to combine our work to make a fully functional game.

									</li>
									<br>
									<li><h3>Leadership and mentoring</h3></li>
									<li style="padding-left: 50px;">
										Another aspect of the project was leading a team of co-op students to help complete other projects on the list. 
										I took this as an opportunity to provide mentorship to students with limited experience in programming 
										and help shape their perspective on what they can create when shown the possibilities. 
 
										<br><br>
										To bring the co-op team up to speed, I had them follow the same learning path I took when I started with Unity. 
										The advantage here was I would be able to share the problems I came across when learning Unity. 
										From this, they could get up and running relatively fast and start creating simple mechanics for the games my co-worker and I had templated.

										Throughout the learning and building process I also made sure to have open discussion sessions with the co-op team. 
										A big part of the experience I wanted them to have for this project was getting them to share ideas and ask questions. 
										For me, it was about being a mentor and sharing any helpful experiences that could inspire and educate.

										<br><br>
										Overall the leadership I provided had a positive outcome for completing the goals for the project and inspiring the students.

								<h2>RBC - Technical Systems Analyst Co-op - 09/2015 - 08/2016  </h2>
								<h3>B2B Connectivity & Digital Image Capture / Exchange</h3>
								<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									<li>I performed unit testing for RBC's business-to-business applications. 
										This required very close attention to detail and strong communication with my team to ensure all code changes made were functional and the expected results were working. 
										I was able to provide exceptional support to my team helping to speed up the process to implementation. 
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>I supported a number of different projects for the DICE Infrastructure team. 
										I worked on organizing and executing a server maintenance plan, documented processes and procedures 
										for proper certificate management, and worked on upgrades to the infrastructure (i.e. setting up MS Clustering to data servers). 
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>Creating efficiencies for my team</li>
									<br>
									<ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
										<li>
											During our team meetings, I noticed that a lot of time was spent getting organized due to an outdated excel tool. 
											It took longer to update statues and add new task items in an organized manner.
											 
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>
											Recognizing this I took the initiative and improved on the excel tool that the team relied heavily on to track application updates. 
											With the input from other team members on important details, 
											I redesigned the excel tool to make it easier to use which resulted in greater productivity and organization of team meetings.
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>
											Overall I made a major improvement in the team meetings as it became easier to update and add work items.
											This made my manager's job, communicating to the directors on work items and statuses easier to do and had a lasting impact on the overall team efficiency. 
											A bonus to the redesign was the ability to now generate insightful metrics that my team's director could use to get an overview of the work items and plan more effectively.
										</li>

								<h2>University of Waterloo - BSc Honours Biology - (2010 - 2014)</h2>
								<!-- <h4>Volunteer experience during my university years.</h4>
								<ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
									<li>
										<h4>Let's Talk Science Ambassador</h4>
										<p>As part of an Ambassador team, I taught elementary school kids about cell division and genetics. 
											To help the students understand the topics, I used visual examples and an interactive game to build a butterfly by selecting random traits. 
											The outcome was engaging and fun for the students while also being educational.   

										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<h4>SouthLake Regional Health Center Volunteer</h4>
										<p>During the summer before my final year, I volunteered at Southlake Hospital to gain experience in the healthcare field. 
											I volunteered as a helper with elderly patients providing communication support and helping facilitate activities. 
											I also volunteered in the blood bank and cytology lab, helping sort samples for the lab technicians and learning more about the profession.
