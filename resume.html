								<h2>STEMMINDS Corp - Director of Technology / STEM Educator - 05/2018 - 01/2020</h2>
								<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									<li>At STEMMINDS Corp I worked as a STEM Educator and Lead Game developer pushing myself to learn new technologies, more effective teaching methods and 
										expand on creative ideas to make STEM topics fun and engaging. 
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>My Accomplishments</li>
									<br>
									<ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
										<li>I developed strong communication skills by teaching a variety of different STEM topics from robotics, to Arduino, to video game design. 
											I was successful in adapting to kid's different levels of understanding and simplifying concepts to make them easier to learn. 
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>
											I taught several different topics which gave me the opportunity to develop engaging activities 
											where kids could express their creativity and problem solving skills. Some examples of these activities are:
											<ul>
												<li>I designed large mazes for kids to program their robot to solve using basic concepts in programming such as loops.</li>
												<li>I also created engineering challenges that needed to be solved with lego or K'nex and added a unique twist to the scenario making the activity more fun and challenging. </li>
											</ul>
										</li>

										<li>
											I successfully led several small teams of Co-op students, mentoring them through the Unity game engine to create 
											several mini-games for the company's online STEM learning platform.
										</li>
										<br>
										<li>I designed and developed several computer games using the Unity game engine for the company's online STEM learning platform. 
											In the first video, I designed and coded the UI to control the robot's actions. 
											For the second game, I designed an isometric detective game where the player needs to find an art thief. 
										</li>

								<h2>RBC - Technical Systems Analyst Co-op (Digital Image Capture / Exchange) - 05/2016 - 08/2016</h2>
								<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									<li>As a TSA Co-op on the DICE Infrastructure team, I supported a number of different projects. 
										I worked on organizing and executing a server maintenance plan, documented processes and procedures 
										for proper certificate management, and worked on upgrades to the infrastructure (i.e. setting up MS Clustering to data servers). 
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>My Acomplishments</li>
									<br>
									<ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
										
										<li>In 4 months I improved the functionality of key documents which resulted in useful reporting for the team and managers. 
											These reports allow for more efficient planning when it came to maintenance of the application and easier locating of key information.</li>
									
									</ul>

								<h2>RBC - Technical Systems Analyst Co-op (Tech & Operations) - 09/2015 - 04/2016  </h2>
								<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
									<li>As a Technical System Analyst, I performed unit testing for RBCâ€™s business-to-business applications. 
										This required very close attention to detail and strong communication with my team to ensure all code changes made were functional and the expected results were working. 
										I was able to provide exceptional support to my team helping to speed up the process to implementation. 
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>My Acomplishments</li>
									<br>
									<ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
										
										<li>I improved on the team's master list of work items by creating an efficient and simpler document. 
											This resulted in faster more constructive team meetings when it came to discussing work items. 
											In addition, I also created a high-level overview of the teams' work items for my managers to plan and report on significant application changes.</li>

								<h4>Volunteer experience during my university years.</h4>
								<ul style="padding-left: 50px;">
									<li>
										<h4>Let's Talk Science Ambassador</h4>
										<p>As part of an Ambassador team, I taught elementary school kids about cell division and genetics. 
											To help the students understand the topics, I used visual examples and an interactive game to build a butterfly by selecting random traits. 
											The outcome was engaging and fun for the students while also being educational.
